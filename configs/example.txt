To analyze TSLA stock and provide a portfolio recommendation, I will:

1. Have the Researcher extract key financial data and ratios from TSLA's SEC filings using the TextReaderTool, get_financial_statements, and get_key_financial_ratios tools. 

2. Have the Web Analyzer scrape recent news about TSLA and analyze the sentiment using the WebScraperTool and get_company_news tools.

3. Have the Wikipedia Expert provide background information on Tesla as a company using the WikipediaSearchTool.

4. Have the Summarizer compile a summary of the financial data, news sentiment, and company background. 

5. Have the Planner analyze the summarized information and make a buy/hold/sell recommendation for including TSLA in an investment portfolio.
