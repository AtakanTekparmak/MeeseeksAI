Here is the agent graph and metadata to analyze NVDA and provide portfolio recommendations:

<scratchpad>
To analyze NVDA stock and provide a portfolio recommendation, I will:

1. Have the Financial Analyst extract key financial data and ratios from NVDA's SEC filings using the search_10k and search_10q tools. 

2. Have the Research Analyst gather recent news, press releases, and market sentiment about NVDA using the google_search_and_scrape and get_company_news tools.

3. Have the Investment Advisor analyze the financial data and market research to formulate a comprehensive investment thesis and portfolio recommendation for NVDA.

4. Have the Summarizer compile the key insights and recommendations into a concise executive summary.
